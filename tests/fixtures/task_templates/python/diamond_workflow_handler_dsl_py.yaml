# TaskTemplate Configuration - DSL Variant - Python Implementation
#
# Diamond Workflow Pattern with Python Step Handlers via FFI (PyO3)
# Demonstrates parallel execution followed by convergence using Python handlers called from Rust
#
# Template: diamond_workflow/parallel_computation_py:1.0.0
# Implementation: Python FFI with tasker-py (PyO3)
# Updated: 2025-12-13
#
# Diamond Pattern:
# 1. Start: Square the initial even number (6 -> 36)
# 2. Branch B (Left): Add 25 to squared result (36 + 25 = 61)
# 3. Branch C (Right): Multiply squared result by 2 (36 * 2 = 72)
# 4. End: Average both branch results ((61 + 72) / 2 = 66.5)
