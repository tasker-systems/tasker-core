# TaskTemplate Configuration - DSL Variant - Ruby Implementation
#
# Diamond Workflow Pattern with Ruby Step Handlers via FFI
# Demonstrates parallel execution followed by convergence using Ruby handlers called from Rust
#
# Template: diamond_workflow/parallel_computation:1.0.0
# Implementation: Ruby FFI with tasker-rb
# Updated: 2025-09-24 (Fixed Template Format)
#
# Diamond Pattern:
# 1. Start: Square the initial even number (6 → 36)
# 2. Branch B (Left): Add 25 to squared result (36 + 25 = 61)
# 3. Branch C (Right): Multiply squared result by 2 (36 × 2 = 72)
# 4. End: Average both branch results ((61 + 72) ÷ 2 = 66.5)
